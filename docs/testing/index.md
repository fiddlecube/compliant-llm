# Testing

## Prompt testing

Prompt testing involves assessing the system with minimal knowledge of its internal workings. This approach helps identify vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers.

To perform prompt testing with Compliant LLM, you'll need:

1. **Prompt Configuration**
   - Target LLM endpoint URL
   - Required HTTP headers
   - Expected response format

2. **Security Context**
   - Understanding of the LLM's intended user engagement
   - Knowledge of its safety policies
   - Familiarity with its harmful request handling mechanisms

This approach helps identify potential security gaps in the LLM's implementation and response handling.


## Blackbox testing

Black-box testing of LLMs involves assessing the system with minimal knowledge of its internal workings. This approach helps identify vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers.

To perform black-box testing with Compliant LLM, you'll need:

1. **API Configuration**
   - Target LLM endpoint URL
   - Required HTTP headers
   - Expected response format

2. **Security Context**
   - Understanding of the LLM's intended user engagement
   - Knowledge of its safety policies
   - Familiarity with its harmful request handling mechanisms

This approach helps identify potential security gaps in the LLM's implementation and response handling.
